# Ex4_OOP
Welcome to Ex4_OOP - the Last task in OOP course in Ariel University.

This project is about Graph theory, Pokemons and more!.
here we continue Ex2_OOP, we use the graph (MyDWG) and the graph algorithms (MyDWG_Algo) in Ex2.
every time we want to start the game we need to turn on server (Here How To Run) that sends us graph, pokemons location on the graph and agents.
The Goal of the game: write the best algorithm for the agents to catch them all !!.
you can read more details in this repository's [wiki page](https://github.com/bargoldenberg/Ex4_OOP/wiki)
